Somewhere in here we need image manipulation tools.
They don't have to be terribly smart at first, but
they should be able to resize a properly proportioned
photo to standard postcard size (1275 x 1875). 

I'd like to see transparent support for:

- sips on Mac OS X
- ImageMagick

plus anything else that has a "resize" one-liner.

There are algorithms that will automatically crop
a photo to find a face, like "autocrop" at
<https://github.com/leblancfg/autocrop>. This is
interesting but out of scope for now.
