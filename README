postcard

this is a project to create postcards for mailing.

mostly this is a wishlist kind of thing, but as a stake
in the ground here's something like a structure for it.

the main application is the command line app:

postcard -to mom -photo cute-kids.jpg -message "they get so big so fast! love ed"

which should generate a job at some print service to
send a postcard in the mail with that text on it to
that address.

which suggests several helper/helpful requirements:

address/

tools for address management, manipulation, databases etc

image/

tools for managing and maintaining photographs and other art

text/

tools for turning text into lovely text for the text side of
the screen

printer/

the printer side of this world, including job queuing and other
outsourced printing options

printer/moo

tools for printing; should import this one:
